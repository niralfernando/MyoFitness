FitnessCoach is a multi platform solution for user to keep track of the number of repetitions performed when exercising. The finite state machine algorithms implmented using 3d spatial data from smart EMG sensing band (Myo), also ensures the user is doing the muscle movements corrently. Myo data is analyzed through an android phone. Once finite state machine implmented using myo 3d spatial data identifies a completition of one exercise, the android phone will notify user's pebble watch by providing haptic feedback.
